CPSIoTSec'20: The Joint Workshop on CPS&IoT Security and Privacy
In conjunction with the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2020

Scope
The Joint Workshop on CPS&IoT Security and Privacy invites academia, industry, and governmental entities to submit:
* Original research papers on the security and privacy of CPS&IoT
* Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers on the security and privacy of CPS&IoT
* Demos (hands-on or videos) of testbeds/experiences of CPS&IoT security and privacy research
We seek submissions from multiple interdisciplinary backgrounds tackling security and privacy issues in CPS&IoT, including but not limited to:
* Mathematical foundations for secure CPS/IoT
* Control-theoretic approaches 
* High assurance security architectures
* Security and resilience metrics
* Metrics and risk assessment approaches
* Identity and access management
* Privacy and trust 
* Network security
* Game theory applied to CPS/IoT security
* Human factors, humans in the loop, and usable security
* Understanding dependencies among security, reliability and safety in CPS/IoT
* Economics of security and privacy
* Intrusion and anomaly detection 
* Model-based security systems engineering
* Sensor and actuator attacks
* CPS/IoT malware analysis
* CPS/IoT firmware analysis
* Hardware-assisted CPS/IoT security

Also, of interest will be papers that can point the research community to new research directions, and those that can set research agendas and priorities in CPS/IoT security and privacy. There will be a best paper award.

Submission guidelines
Submissions include long papers (12 pages) and short papers (6 pages):
Long papers include: 
a) Original research on a CPS/IoT security and privacy topic 
b) Systematization of Knowledge of CPS/IoT security and privacy

 Short papers include:
a) Original preliminary research on a CPS/IoT security and privacy topic
b) Demos/interesting findings/insights on CPS/IoT security and privacy 
Submitted papers can be up to 12 or 6 pages including appendices and references (except for SoK papers where references are excluded). Submissions must use the format defined by CCS (https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2020/call-for-papers.html). Only PDF files will be accepted. Accepted papers will be published by the ACM Press and/or the ACM Digital Library. Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Each accepted paper must be presented by a registered author. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk immediate rejection. For questions about these policies, please contact the chairs.
