                  <p>In industrial circles, academic research is frequently discussed as being disconnected
                     from the real-world security problems and needs. Additionally, the critics highlight
                     that academic research is largely driven by fashionable research topics/ideas and
                     discourages bold innovative thinking. While admittedly this has been a relevant concern
                     and pressing issue in the past, things are slowly changing. One can find more and
                     more innovative and applied security research which makes it to the industrial conference
                     stages and newspapers. Also, companies are closing Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA)
                     with the academic research groups to work on the security needs of their products
                     and software. This talk will discuss current trends in the cyber security research
                     ecosystem as well as provide suggestions on how to select and formulate real-world
                     applied research problems. Firstly, we will cover the recent changes observed in industrial
                     and academic research. We will argue that industrial research is increasingly becoming
                     more commercial and thus less publicly available, whereas academic research groups
                     are increasingly tackling real-world research topics and attack surface. We then discuss
                     how to select research topics that are relevant to industrial needs and simultaneously
                     offer academic research component. We will also cover successful academic writing
                     and industrial presentation styles.

                  <p>With the rise of malware targeting industrial control systems, researchers need more
                     tools to develop a better understanding of the networks under attack, the potential
                     behavior of malware, and design possible defenses. One of the most important protocols
                     used in practice today is IEC 104, which is used to monitor and control the Power
                     Grid of several countries, as well as to monitor and control other critical infrastructures
                     such as gas, oil, and water systems. In this paper we present our preliminary results
                     in implementing the IEC 104 industrial protocol standard in Python and integrate it
                     to a network emulation tool supported by Mininet.

                  <p>Adversarial actors have shown their ability to infiltrate enterprise networks deployed
                     around Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) through social engineering, credential stealing
                     and file-less infections. When inside, they can gain enough privileges to maliciously
                     call legitimate APIs and apply unsafe control actions to degrade the system performance
                     and undermine its safety. Our work lies at the intersection of security and safety,
                     and aims to understand dependencies among security, reliability and safety in CPS/IoT.
                     We present a methodology to perform hazard driven threat modelling and impact assessment
                     in the context of CPSs. The process starts from the analysis of behavioural, functional
                     and architectural models of the CPS. We then apply System Theoretic Process Analysis
                     (STPA) on the functional model to highlight high-level abuse cases. We leverage a
                     mapping between the architectural and the system theoretic(ST) models to enumerate
                     those components whose impairment provides the attacker with enough privileges to
                     tamper with or disrupt the data-flows. This enables us to find a causal connection
                     between the attack surface (in the architectural model) and system level losses. We
                     then link the behavioural and system theoretic representations of the CPS to quantify
                     the impact of the attack. Using our methodology it is possible to compute a comprehensive
                     attack graph of the known attack paths and to perform both a qualitative and quantitative
                     impact assessment of the exploitation of vulnerabilities affecting target nodes. The
                     framework and methodology are illustrated using a small scale example featuring a
                     Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) system. Aspects regarding the scalability
                     of our methodology and its application in real world scenarios are also considered.
                     Finally, we discuss the possibility of using the results obtained to engineer both
                     design time and real time defensive mechanisms.

                  <p>In recent years, several schemes have been proposed to detect anomalies and attacks
                     on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) such as Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). Based
                     on the analysis of sensor data, unexpected or malicious behavior is detected. Those
                     schemes often rely on (implicit) assumptions on temporally stable sensor data distributions
                     and invariants between process values. Unfortunately, the proposed schemes often perform
                     not optimally with Recall scores lower than 70% (e.g., missing 3 alarms every 10 anomalies)
                     for some ICS datasets, with unclear root issues.
                  </p> 
                  <p>In this work, we propose a general framework to check whether a given ICS dataset
                     has specific properties (stable sensor distributions in normal operations, potentially
                     state-dependent), which then allows to determine whether certain Anomaly Detection
                     approaches can be expected to perform well. We apply our framework to three datasets
                     showing that the behavior of actuators and sensors are very different between Training
                     set and Test set. In addition, we present high-level guides to consider when designing
                     an Anomaly Detection System.

                  <p>In existing literature, various machine learning models have been applied to detect
                     cyber attacks on the power grid. None of them, however, consider the degradation of
                     the model over time due to the distributed and dynamic nature of the power system.
                     At the same time, they also fail to recognize natural events, such as line maintenance,
                     since they are based on binary classification (attack/no attack). In an effort to
                     develop a cyber security protection strategy that will work robustly for an extended
                     period of time, we develop a methodology based on the LightGBM framework, which performs
                     well for a) Training for multi-class events (no attack/natural event/attack), and
                     b) Fast, dynamic retraining with concept drift detection. We use an ensemble learning-based
                     classifier for classifying the events generated through our Real Time Digital Simulatorwith

                  <p>The number of IoT devices designed and marketed in these last years is continuously
                     growing. These smart things are more often managed through the cloud, therefore more
                     and more devices are connected both to the customer's local networks and to the Internet.
                     Among the several network pairing mechanisms designed for the IoT domain, we examined
                     the Smart Config family of protocols, a clever technology that allows an IoT device
                     to be associated with an existing WiFi network by receiving special packets from an
                     already network-paired smartphone. We investigate the threats and the technical details
                     behind the ESP Touch protocol, a Smart Config implementation developed by Espressif
                     Systems for its ESP32/8266 family of chips. Additionally, we present a security analysis
                     of the same protocol implemented by the ITEAD Sonoff smart switches (and also by many
                     other ESP-based devices), that we conducted by reverse-engineering the eWeLink mobile
                     companion application. In conclusion, we describe a vulnerability (published as CVE-2020-12702)
                     we found in the Quick Pairing mode of the eWeLink SDK that leads to a full WiFi credential
                     disclosure during the device pairing process.

                  <p>Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are central to the operation of critical national
                     infrastructure (CNI) such as oil and gas, water treatment, power generation and transport
                     systems. Effective risk management to mitigate large-scale disruption to societies
                     and economies depends on both timely information about vulnerabilities and the consistency
                     of this information. The longer the vulnerabilities remain "in the wild" or a lack
                     of consistency in vulnerability reporting, the greater the impact on CNI operators'
                     ability to systematically understand and mitigate the risks. In this paper, we focus
                     on vulnerabilities identified and reported in Siemens ICS devices, which hold the
                     largest share of the market. We undertake an in-depth analysis of 207 CVEs, identifying
                     the time over which vulnerabilities were 'in the wild' before being discovered and
                     advisories issued, and examine issues with the correctness of CVE information. We
                     find that, on average, a vulnerability is 'in the wild' for 5.3 years, and that many
                     CVEs do not correctly reflect and state the affected devices as Common Platform Enumerations
                     (CPEs). Based on our findings, we propose a set of guidelines to improve the reporting
                     and consistency of ICS CVE information.

                  <p>Bluetooth-enabled smartphones, wearable devices, as well as consumer electronics devices,
                     are pervasive nowadays. Due to the low power consumption of Bluetooth hardware, users
                     often leave Bluetooth enabled on their personal devices all the time. We find that
                     even though the devices themselves may be protected against unauthorized connections,
                     neighboring Bluetooth signals may still leak personal information. More specifically,
                     a malicious smartphone application can easily obtain permission to perform Bluetooth
                     scanning and then build a temporal trace of the number of active Bluetooth devices
                     in the vicinity of a user. By collecting and analyzing data from 49 smartphone users
                     over two weeks, we found that traces from different devices have little overlap and
                     can, therefore, be used to identify a device with high likelihood. Moreover, Bluetooth
                     advertisements from nearby devices can reveal what products the user may own making
                     her susceptible to targeted advertisements. By comparing Bluetooth traces from multiple
                     devices, the adversary can learn a user's location even if she does not give explicit
                     permission to share her location. We also analyzed a public Bluetooth dataset to find
                     similarities and differences with the conclusions drawn from our dataset. Our dataset
                     has been publicly released for the scientific community.

                  <p>Industrial control systems (ICS) are the systems responsible for the control and operation
                     of both critical national infrastructure (CNI), including oil and gas, water treatment
                     and power generation, aswell as manufacturing processes. ICS are made up of many speciality
                     devices, including programmable logic controllers (PLCs), remote telemetry units (RTUs)
                     and human-machine interfaces (HMIs), with major manufacturers including Siemens, Allen
                     Bradley, Honeywell, Schneider Electric and General Electric. These systems are often
                     referred to as Operational Technology (OT). In ICS, safety is the number one concern,
                     with devices designed to operate reliably for many years. The security of such devices
                     was largely physical - they were designed to sit without an Internet connection behind
                     locked doors. In modern times, however, this is not the case with devices regularly
                     being connected to the Internet. Incidents such as the Stuxnet and Triton malware,
                     which specifically target industrial systems, and legislation such as the European
                     Network and Information Systems (NIS) directive have put the cyber security of industrial
                     systems very much in the focus. As part of this, there are an increasing number of
                     vulnerabilities being discovered, and eventually patched, in industrial devices.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Human machine interfaces (HMIs) primarily refer to a physical device which is designed
                     to be installed in physical proximity to an industrial process. HMI screens are programmed
                     to both provide a display of information relating to the physical process below and
                     allow operators to provide inputs to the control system to control and manage physical
                     processes. These screens can vary from a few inches in size up to 'full size' monitors,
                     with modern devices usually featuring a touchscreen, and in some cases a set of physical
                     inputs including buttons and knobs. Most ICS manufacturers produce some range of HMI
                     screens, including Siemens who produce a wide range of these devices.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Some HMIs support remote access, which allows operators in a central location to access
                     screens that human operators are unable to access. This provides obvious benefits,
                     allowing engineers to correct issues remotely as well as monitor and control processes.
                     Device manufacturers provide their own methods for this remote access. Communication
                     is usually achieved over network connections, with most modern devices featuring an
                     ethernet port and/or wireless connectivity. In the case of Siemens, the primary method
                     is through the use of the VNC-based Sm@rtServer system available on most of their
                     HMI range, which provides access through a Sm@rtClient application (available for
                     PC, Android and iOS), as well as through third party VNC clients.
                  </p> 
                  <p>We discovered a vulnerability in Siemens HMI products that allows an attacker to be
                     able to brute force the Sm@rtServer password. On basic devices, we find that there
                     is no protection against brute forcing the Sm@rtServer, allowing for the use of existing
                     online password cracking tools. We discover that on higher end devices, the Sm@rtServer
                     employs a form of brute-force prevention, which we were able to evade allowing for
                     slightly slower, but still overall successful, brute force attempts. Successfully
                     guessing this password could in some cases grant an attacker full control over the
                     HMI screen, and therefore control over the underlying process, causing a potentially
                     dangerous, life threatening situation. Further, due toca limitation in the VNC protocol,
                     passwords longer than 8 characters are truncated by the clients, which allows an attacker
                     to successfully authenticate to the device with a longer password as long as the first
                     8 characters are correct, potentially aiding in the brute force attempt.
                  </p> 
                  <p>After disclosure to Siemens, this vulnerability has been assigned 2 CVEs - CVE-2020-15786
                     for the brute force issue and CVE-2020- 15787 for the password truncation issue, both
                     addressed in Siemens Security Advisory (SSA) 524525.

                  <p>MAC-layer spoofing, also known as identity spoofing, is recognized as a serious problem
                     in many practical wireless systems. IoT systems are particularly vulnerable to this
                     type of attack, as IoT devices (due to their various limitations) are often incapable
                     of deploying advanced MAC-layer spoofing prevention and detection techniques - such
                     as cryptographic authentication. Signal-level device fingerprinting is an approach
                     to identity spoofing detection that is highly suitable for sensor-based IoT networks,
                     but can be also utilized in many other types of wireless system. Unfortunately, the
                     previous research works on signal-level device fingerprinting have been based on rather
                     simplistic assumptions about both - the adversary's behavior as well as the operation
                     of the defense system. The goal of our work was to examine the effectiveness of a
                     novel system that combines signal-level device fingerprinting with the principles
                     of Randomized Moving Target Defense (RMTD) when dealing with a very advanced adversary.
                     The obtained results show that our RMTD-enhanced signal-level device fingerprinting
                     technique exhibits far superior defense performance over the non-RMTD techniques previously
                     discussed in the literature, and as such could be of great value for practical wireless
                     systems subjected to identity spoofing attacks.

                  <p>We consider the problem of provably securing a given control loop implementation in
                     the presence of adversarial interventions on data exchange between plant and controller.
                     Such interventions can be thwarted using continuously operating monitoring systems
                     and also cryptographic techniques, both of which consume network and computational
                     resources. We provide a principled approach for intentional skipping of control loop
                     executions which may qualify as a useful control-theoretic countermeasure against
                     stealthy attacks which violate message integrity and authenticity. As can be seen,
                     such an approach helps in lowering the resource consumption caused by monitoring/cryptographic
                     security measures.

                  <p>Smart home speakers are deployed in millions of homes around the world. These speakers
                     enable users to interact with other IoT devices in the household and provide voice
                     assistance such as telling the weather and reminding appointments. Although smart
                     home speakers facilitate many aspects of our life, security and privacy concerns should
                     be analyzed and addressed. In this paper, we show that an attacker sniffing the network
                     traffic of smart speakers can infer voice commands and compromise the privacy of users.
                     Specifically, we propose a method that utilizes the network traffic of the speakers
                     to fingerprint the voice commands of users without a need for extracting traffic features
                     with machine learning algorithms. We evaluated the proposed method on traffic traces
                     of 100 different voice commands on smart home speakers. Our approach correctly infers
                     42% of voice commands while machine learning models infer 22% to 34%. We also evaluated
                     the effectiveness of the padding method recommended for preventing voice command fingerprinting
                     and observed that the accuracy of proposed fingerprinting method drops down to 15%
                     and accuracy of machine learning methods ranges from 6% to 15% with traffic padding.
